<title>About Our OS</title>
<h2>Background Of Our Operating System</h2>
<hr>
<h3></h3>
<p>
    Our operating system is the culmination of 8 weeks of work done by the BEASTS: Will, Jack, Manas, and Stephen.<br>
    Designing the 3rd MP of <a href="https://courses.grainger.illinois.edu/ECE391/sp2023/" target="_blank">ECE 391 Spring 2023</a>, Computer Systems Engineering, was actually the most fun of any class so far at UIUC! (Hopefully our long days will see the light of day).
</p>
<h3>Website Design</h3>
<p>
    This website's text is based off the open source code on <a href="https://github.com/paizhangpi/391os36_web" target="_blank">GitHub</a> with <a href="https://github.com/paizhangpi/391os36_web/blob/main/LICENSE" target="_blank">MIT License</a> made by the wonderful Paizhang.<br>
    Check out the <a href="./overview.html" target="_blank">Technical Overview</a> to see actual work that was done. <br>

<h3>How the OS Emulation Was Made:</h3>
<p>
    This online emulation is powered by <a href="https://github.com/copy/v86" target="_blank">v86 (which you need the same version of llvm as rust, who knew)</a>.<br>
    The website design comes directly from the <a href="https://courses.grainger.illinois.edu/ece391/" target="_blank">ECE 391 website</a>.<br>
    The font used in the emulator is IBM VGA, which was made from the IBM VGA video BIOS.<br>
